## RGL API vs. RGL core

The [Resource Grammar Library](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis/index.html) (RGL) is the standard library of GF. To appreciate this section, you should be familiar with [Lesson 4 in the GF tutorial](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/tutorial/gf-tutorial.html#toc69), everything before the section on [functors](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/tutorial/gf-tutorial.html#toc90).


### Using the RGL in an application grammar
This is how we learn to use the RGL: open the API modules `SyntaxXxx` or `ParadigmsXxx` in our application grammar. A minimal example:

```haskell
abstract Example = {
  cat
    Comment ;
  fun
    example_Comment : Comment ;
}
```

Let's do an English concrete for this grammar.

```haskell
concrete ExampleEng of Example = open SyntaxEng,
                                      ParadigmsEng in {
  lincat
    Comment = Utt ; -- category Utt comes from SyntaxEng
  lin
    example_Comment =
      mkUtt         -- opers mkUtt, mkNP, a_Det
        (mkNP a_Det -- come from SyntaxEng
          (mkN "example") -- mkN comes from ParadigmsEng
        ) ;
}
```

I trust that you have seen, and probably used, something like this before. All of the `mkXxx` things are `oper`s, and you can use them in defining your `lin`s.


### Insides of the RGL

Depending on where you learned GF, you might have seen something like the following.

<img src="/images/open-RGL-in-GF-shell.png"
     alt="Screenshot of a GF shell, where LangEng.gfo is open, and we see an abstract syntax tree for 'the cat sleeps': PredVP (DetCN (DetQuant DefArt NumSg) (UseN cat_N)) (UseV sleep_V)."/>

The screenshot is showing a GF shell, where I've opened a GF file called `LangEng.gfo`. Then I parsed the sentence *"the cat sleeps"*, and got the following abstract syntax tree.

```haskell
PredVP
  (DetCN (DetQuant DefArt NumSg) (UseN cat_N))
  (UseV sleep_V)
```

This is glimpse to the abstract syntax of the RGL. All of these words, like `PredVP` and `DefArt`, are `fun`s in modules such as [Sentence.gf](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl/blob/master/src/abstract/Sentence.gf) or [Noun.gf](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl/blob/master/src/abstract/Noun.gf#L81-L86), and `lin`s in their respective [SentenceEng.gf](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl/blob/master/src/english/SentenceEng.gf), [NounRus.gf](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl/blob/master/src/russian/NounRus.gf) or any other of the 40+ languages in the RGL.

No need to understand the linked code, I just wanted to show where to find the RGL source.

### History lesson

#### Before RGL

Once upon a time, there was no RGL. All grammars looked like the [Foods grammar](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-contrib/blob/master/foods/FoodsEng.gf) that isn't using the RGL, or the examples from [lesson 3](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/tutorial/gf-tutorial.html#toc46) of the GF tutorial.

<!-- Soon, it got very tiring to have to define noun inflection, verb conjugation, word order, preposition contraction and whatnot for every new application grammar. The domains of, say, mathematics and healthcare may be very different in vocabulary and style, so it makes sense to write different application grammars for them. But regardless of the domain, Italian adjectives need to agree in number and gender with their head.  -->

Defining all those opers again for each new application grammar would get tiring. English nouns inflect just the same, no matter if the domain is mathematics of health care. So the obvious first idea is to save those `param`s and `oper`s [from line 29 on](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-contrib/blob/master/foods/FoodsEng.gf#L29-L42) and reuse them for other English grammars.

```haskell
  param
    Number = Sg | Pl ;
  oper
    det : Number -> Str ->
      {s : Number => Str} -> {s : Str ; n : Number} =
        \n,det,noun -> {s = det ++ noun.s ! n ; n = n} ;
    noun : Str -> Str -> {s : Number => Str} =
      \man,men -> {s = table {Sg => man ; Pl => men}} ;
    regNoun : Str -> {s : Number => Str} =
      \car -> noun car (car + "s") ;
    adj : Str -> {s : Str} =
      \cold -> {s = cold} ;
    copula : Number => Str =
      table {Sg => "is" ; Pl => "are"} ;
```

So we save this into a resource module called `ProtoRGLEng.gf`. It's a good start, but there are limitations.

Nothing requires the whole set of `oper`s to be internally consistent. The type `{s : Number => Str}` is used in `noun` and `det`, but one of them could easily change, and the  `ProtoRGLEng` module will still compile. Only when you try to compile an application grammar that uses those opers, it will stop working.

In addition, nothing requires the opers in `ProtoRGLEng` and, say, `ProtoRGLIta` to be consistent with each other. Some things are necessarily different in such opers, like inflection tables for adjective---1 form in English, 4 forms in Italian. But other choices are arbitrary, like how to implement determiners. The code below illustrates two alternatives.

```haskell
oper
  -- Common ground: Nouns and NPs
  Noun : Type ;
  NP : Type ;

-- Option 1: Determiner as a category
  Det : Type ;
  this_Det, that_Det : Det ;
  addDet : Det -> Noun -> NP ;

-- Option 2: Determiners as functions Noun -> NP
  this, that : Noun -> NP ;
```

Decisions like that don't really matter much in the grand scheme of things, but it's annoying to try to remember which languages choose `addDet this_Det SomeNoun` and which choose `this SomeNoun`. And while we're talking about annoying, is it really necessary to keep thinking about the differences between Italian and English adjective inflection?

Now is there a way in GF to force a common, abstract idea and hide the implementation details? ðŸ¤”

Sounds like we're better off defining this resource with *abstract* and *concrete* syntaxes. that is, `fun`s and `lin`s instead of `oper`s.


### Before RGL API

You can use RGL without the API


To recreate the minimal grammar,


<!-- Opening Syntax brings most of Lang into scope, with standard API overloaded names. So if you opened LangEng and SyntaxEng in an application, then you'd have e.g. `mkNP` and `DetCN` both in scope. -->

<!--  GF grammarian's journey where they find out that the RGL is made of ~~people~~abstract syntax. -->
