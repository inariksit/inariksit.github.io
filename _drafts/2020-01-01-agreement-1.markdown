Lately I've been thinking about verbal agreement in various GF resource grammars.

This will be a series of three posts. (I publish this plan so that I will feel the pressure to actually write them.)
The first post---this one---is an introduction to verbal agreement, most useful for a reader with little knowledge in linguistics or GF. The second post will be about implicit arguments: how do we model the real world adding all kinds of inconvenient restrictions on how we speak. In the third post I will talk about obliques and how, if you squint enough, you can kind of interpret preposition contraction and other unrelated things as agreement!

If you're a seasoned GF grammarian and have any familiarity with linguistics, the first post won't be all that new information, but you surely wouldn't want to miss my hot takes on ergativity. If you don't know what ergativity means, that's a sign that you need to read the first post.


## Agreement in linguistics

Verbal agreement means that one or more of the verb's arguments are marked in the verb form. If you're not familiar with other languages than Standard Average European, you've probably only seen subject agreement:

 &nbsp;          |1st person singular | 3rd person singular
-----------------|----------------|---------------------------
**Intransitive** |I sleep-**∅**       | the cat sleep**s**
**Transitive**   |I drink-**∅** water | the cat drink**s** water
-----------------|----------------|---------------------------

Both verbs, *sleep* and *drink*, only show marking for the subject: null morpheme for *I*, and -s for *the cat*. *Water*, which is the object of *drink*, doesn't contribute to the conjugation. Contrast this with Hungarian [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_verbs#Definite_and_indefinite_conjugations)]:

<img src="/images/hungarian-agreement.png" alt="Screenshot of Wikipedia. The text reads: In Hungarian, verbs not only show agreement with their subjects but also carry information on the definiteness of their direct objects. This results in two types of conjugations: definite (used if there is a definite object) and indefinite (if there is no definite object" />

In fact, multiple agreement is pretty common in languages around the world. The map below is taken from [World Atlas of Language Structures](https://wals.info/) (WALS): red dot means "like English", orange dot means "like Hungarian".

<a id="person-marking-wals" href="https://wals.info/combinations/102A?v3=cffc&v1=cd00&v0=cfff&v2=cff0&v4=cfc0#2/16.7/148.6"><img src="/images/person-marking-wals.png" /></a>

<!-- > Verbal person marking of just the A [agent] is most common in Eurasia. It is characteristic of most of the Indo-European languages of Europe, the Uralic languages of Russia, Finland, Estonia and Hungary, the Turkic languages, and the Dravidian languages of India. It is also found in eastern Africa, especially among the Afro-Asiatic languages, in the north of South America and in New Guinea. By contrast, it is extremely rare in North America and there is no instance of it among the languages in the sample in Australia. Verbal person marking of just the P [patient] is an infrequent phenomenon everywhere. -->

Now I'll present different options for argument marking, and how to do them in GF.

For simplicity, I'm only showing positive present indicative forms. You can freely assume, in addition to person marking, some form of tense, aspect, mood etc.

## No person marking

The simplest person marking is no person marking. Let's start easy and do Chinese:

```haskell
lincat
  V,V2 = {s : Str} ;

lin
  sleep_V  = {s = "sleep_in_chinese"} ;

  drink_V2 = {s = "drink_in_chinese"} ;
```

## 1-dimensional person marking

Next possibility, the verb can mark one of its core arguments, subject or object. (Technically, I guess there could be a language that only marked an indirect object, but I've never heard of one. If you're inspired, do make a conlang like that and write a GF grammar for it.)

### Subject marking

Let's use English as an example of subject marking:

```haskell
param
  Agr = Sg3 | Other ;

lincat
  V,V2 = {s : Agr => Str} ;

lin
  sleep_V  = {s = table { Sg3   => "sleeps" ;
                          Other => "sleep" }} ;

  drink_V2 = {s = table { Sg3   => "drinks" ;
                          Other => "drink" }} ;
```

So far we have only created an inflection table---nothing in the code says that we have *subject* marking, just that we have one-dimensional table. But when we add lincats and linearisations for `VP` and `Cl`, it will become apparent which argument the verb marks. The following GF code models English (and other red dots on the WALS map):

#### English

```haskell
lincat
  VP = {s : Agr => Str} ;
  NP = {s : Str ; a : Agr} ;
  Cl = {s : Str} ;

lin
  -- UseV : V -> VP
  UseV v = v ;

  -- ComplV2 : V2 -> NP -> VP
  ComplV2 v2 np = {s = \\agr => v2 ! agr ++ np.s} ;

  -- PredVP : NP -> VP -> Cl
  PredVP np vp = {s = np.s ++ vp.s ! np.a} ;
```

### Object marking

Now, let's implement the missing categories and functions for a language that marks only object, not subject.  According to WALS, this is quite rare but not unheard of; 24 languages of the sample of 378 do that. (They are shown as yellow dots on [the map](#person-marking-wals).)

To keep it simple, let's assume that there is a language just like English but object marking.

|Transitive         |Sg1 subject | Sg3 subject  |
|:-----------------:|:----------|:--------------------------|
|**Sg1 object**   |I drink-**∅** me | the cat drink-**∅** me |
|**Sg3 object**   |I drink-**s** water | the cat drink-**s** water |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------|

You see, "I drink<strong>s</strong> water" would be ungrammatigal in ordinary English, where verbs mark the subject. In contrast, Like-English-but-object-marking puts the -s in *I drinks water* because of *water*, not because of *I*.

Now, the WALS data doesn't tell me what do these 24 languages mark in an intransitive verb, so I decide that in Like-English-but-object-marking, intransitives have no person marking. (There are other options---more on those later!)


| Intransitive    |Sg1 subject | Sg3 subject |
|:---------------:|:----------|:--------------------------|
| &nbsp;          | I sleep-**∅** | the cat sleep-**∅** |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------|

#### Like-English-but-object-marking

```haskell
lincat
  V, VP = {s : Str} ;
  V2 = {s : Agr => Str} ;
  NP = {s : Str ; a : Agr} ;
  Cl = {s : Str} ;

lin
  -- UseV : V -> VP
  UseV v = v ;

  -- ComplV2 : V2 -> NP -> VP
  ComplV2 v2 np = {s = v2.s ! agr ++ np.s} ;

  -- PredVP : NP -> VP -> Cl
  PredVP np vp = {s = np.s ++ vp.s} ;
```

Let's look at the lexical categories, `V` and `V2`. The easy case first: `V2` is still an inflection table `Agr => Str`, only this time `Agr` marks the object. In contrast, the lincat for `V` doesn't need a table, just a string!

This change is reflected in `VP`. It's clear when you look how to construct a VP: either from a `V`, which never inflected, or from a `V2` and a object---just what is needed to pick out the correct form from the `V2`. In turn, `PredVP` is just trivial concatenation, because the subject doesn't contribute anything to the verb inflection.

<!--
In English, `VP` needs to retain its potential for agreement, and only `PredVP` can pick out a string, because that's when the subject is added. In Like-English-but-…, we get rid of the incertainty already at `ComplV2`, and adding subject is just trivial concatenation. -->

<!-- Compare `ComplV2` and `PredVP` in English and Like-English-but-object-marking:

```haskell
-- English
ComplV2 v2 np = {s = \\agr => v2 ! agr ++ np.s} ;

-- Like-English-but-…
ComplV2 v2 np = {s = v2.s ! agr ++ np.s} ;
```

```haskell
-- English
PredVP np vp = {s = np.s ++ vp.s ! np.a} ;

-- Like-English-but-…
PredVP np vp = {s = np.s ++ vp.s} ;
```

Pretty cool right? -->


#### Like-English-but-object-marking'  --- the other option for intransitive

Previously we just had zero marking for intransitive verbs. But there is another strategy that appears in some languages[^1]:
* For transitive verbs, mark the object.
* For intransitive verbs, mark the subject *in the same way* the object is marked for transitive verbs.



(There is a name for this and I will introduce it soon. Let's just finish our Like-English-but series!)


We established already how transitive verbs work:

 |Transitive       |Sg1 subject         | Sg3 subject                     |
 |:---------------:|:-------------------|:--------------------------------|
 |**Sg1 object**   |I drink-**∅** me    | the cat drink-**∅** me          |
 |**Sg3 object**   |I drink-**s** water | the cat drink-**s** water       |
 |-----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|

 Now let's add intransitive verbs. Remember, 1st person singular patient (*me*) is unmarked, so *me* as a subject should also be unmarked. A 3rd person singular patient (*water*) is marked by an __-s__, so it should be marked also as a subject. So this would be an option:

 | Intransitive    | Sg1 subject   | Sg3 subject         |
 |:---------------:|:--------------|:--------------------|
 | &nbsp;          | I sleep-**∅** | the cat sleep-**s** |
 |-----------------|---------------|---------------------|


Now, in this post I'm mostly concerned about verb agreement, but for a proper "mark the subject in the same way as the object" strategy, we should also keep in mind the case marking. *I* is reserved only for the doer of a transitive verb, *me* is both the object of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive verb. So this looks more consistent:

| Intransitive    | Sg1 subject    | Sg3 subject         |
|:---------------:|:---------------|:--------------------|
| &nbsp;          | me sleep-**∅** | the cat sleep-**s** |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|



## Interlude: Nominative-accusative vs. Absolutive-ergative

So far I've used the term *subject* for two things: the only argument of an intransitive verb (*__subject__ sleeps*), and the doer argument of a transitive verb (*__subject__ eats object*).

Now, let's make the definitions a bit narrower. With __<font color="green">subject</font>__, we refer to the only argument of an intransitive verb, whereas transitive verbs have an __<font color="blue">agent</font>__ and a __<font color="purple">patient</font>__. Like this:

<ul>
<li><span title="SUBJECT"><strong><font color="green">the cat</font></strong></span>:S sleeps</li>
<li><span title="AGENT"><strong><font color="blue">the cat</font></strong></span>:A eats <span title="PATIENT (or OBJECT)"><strong><font color="purple">the mouse</font></strong></span>:P</li>
</ul>

____

*How about the word "object"? Doesn't matter all that much: __<font color="purple">agent</font>__ vs. __<font color="green">subject</font>__ is an important distinction regarding argument marking, but "object" and "patient" can be used interchangeably for the non-agent argument of a transitive verb. For (what I hope to be) clarity, I'll use "patient" in contexts where subject/agent distinction is important, and "object" when it doesn't matter. The scope of this decision is this series about agreement; in other posts other rules apply.*

____

With these 3 roles, we have 4 strategies of marking them all:
<ol>
  <li>All same:
    <ul>
    <li><span title="SUBJECT"><strong><font color="green">subject</font></strong></span> sleep</li>
    <li><span title="AGENT"><strong><font color="green">agent</font></strong></span> eat <span title="PATIENT (or OBJECT)"><strong><font color="green">patient</font></strong></span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Subject and agent same:
    <ul>
    <li><span title="SUBJECT"><strong><font color="green">subject</font></strong></span> sleeps</li>
    <li><span title="AGENT"><strong><font color="green">agent</font></strong></span> eats <span title="PATIENT (or OBJECT)"><strong><font color="purple">patient</font></strong></span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Subject and patient same:
    <ul>
    <li><span title="SUBJECT"><strong><font color="purple">subject</font></strong></span> sleeps</li>
    <li><span title="AGENT"><strong><font color="green">agent</font></strong></span> eats <span title="PATIENT (or OBJECT)"><strong><font color="purple">patient</font></strong></span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All different:
    <ul>
    <li><span title="SUBJECT"><strong><font color="green">subject</font></strong></span> sleeps</li>
    <li><span title="AGENT"><strong><font color="blue">agent</font></strong></span> eats <span title="PATIENT (or OBJECT)"><strong><font color="purple">patient</font></strong></span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

Technically there's a 5th alternative; subject is different but agent and patient are the same. But it would be very strange to spend some precious morphemes on just the case where it doesn't make a difference (subject vs. others) and then not spend them where it is actually important---one would want to know whether <font color="green">you</font> see <font color="purple">me</font> or <font color="green">I</font> see <font color="purple">you</font>.

__TODO: explain nominative-accusative vs. absolutive-ergative.__

Some terminology notes follow. I personally think that the terminology is unnecessarily confusing---all these terms conflate a lot of features, whereas in the real world, they can appear in all kinds of combinations.

* The short name for "the strategy of marking subject and patient with absolutive case, and agent with ergative case" is called *ergativity*.
* Such a language is called an *ergative* language.
* A language can be ergative even if it doesn't have case marking. All examples in this post have just used verb inflection. Even if the last example didn't switch the case to "me sleep" but was "I sleep", I'd argue that the language is still pretty ergative in terms of verb inflection.
* Well, it doesn't even need to be in verb inflection, it can be encoded in word order, or through adpositions, or by the speaker wearing a cowboy hat when mentioning the agent, and a pirate hat when mentioning the subject and the patient. The bottom line is: does the language treat subject and patient the same, and agent in another way? If yes, then we have an "ergative" language.


* A bit more exact names are *absolutive-ergative system* and *nominative-accusative system*. Absolutive and nominative are usually the unmarked cases in their respective systems, ergative and accusative are the marked cases. *Nominative-accusative* is such a well-established order, so *absolutive-ergative* follows the pattern.
* For the record, there are also languages where the subject and agent are marked the same way,  case is marked, but are not absolutive-ergative. How do we know the difference? Simple: compare agents and subjects, are they both marked in the same way? If yes, then you have a nominative-accusative system where nominative is the marked one and accusative is the unmarked one. We could call this something else, like nominative-absolutive

## 2-dimensional marking


Next, let's do Hungarian (within the sample shown previously, that is, ignoring the 2nd person object suffix).
Hungarian is nominative-accusative, so for consistency I'm talking about subjects and objects again.

But now that we have 2-dimensional agreement, it stops being relevant for verbal agreement whether we have absolutive-ergative or nominative-accusative system. When we only had to mark one

```haskell
param
  Subject = Sg1 | Sg2 | Sg3 | Pl1 | Pl2 | Pl3 ;
  Object = DefObj | IndefObj ;

lincat
  V  = {s :           Subject => Str} ;
  V2 = {s : Object => Subject => Str} ;

lin
  sleep_V = {s =
    table { Sg1 => "..." ;
                    ...
                    Pl3 => "..." }
  } ;
  drink_V2 = {s =
    table { DefObj   => table { Sg1 => "..." ;
                                ...
                                Pl3 => "..." } ;
            IndefObj => table { Sg1 => "..." ;
                                ...
                                Pl3 => "..." }
          }
  } ;
```

### 3-dimensional marking

And why stop at direct object? If you've read my blog before, you knew this was coming---Basque ditransitive auxiliary agrees with agent, patient and indirect object.

Basque happens to be ergative, so we talk about subject, agent and patient again.


The patient agreement in transitive verbs covers all persons and numbers, but in ditransitive, it's restricted to singular vs. plural. (If someone who knows Basque is reading this and wondering, I'm ignoring second person familiar forms and allocutive for now, but I will introduce them in the next post.) Within these restrictions, we can model Basque verbs as follows:

```haskell
param
  Agr = Sg1 | Sg2 | Sg3 | Pl1 | Pl2 | Pl3 ;
  DtPat = SgPat | PlPat ;

lincat
  V  = {s :                 Agr => Str } ;
  V2 = {s :          Agr => Agr => Str } ;
  V3 = {s : DtPat => Agr => Agr => Str } ;
```

Let's start from the order of the arguments.

Also, the fact that Basque is absolutive-ergative is actually not at all interesting from verb inflection perspective. We need to mark both, so the argument marking strategy doesn't bring anything new to the verbs, unlike Like-English-but-patient-marking-and-ergative, which was an exciting and novel way of inflecting English verbs.

We do notice ergativity in Basque in nominal cases.

```haskell
  sleep : IntransVerb =
    table { Sg1 => "..." ;
            ...
            Pl3 => "..." } ;

  drink : TransVerb =
    table { Def   => table { Sg1 => "..." ;
                             ...
                             Pl3 => "..." } ;
            Indef => table { Sg1 => "..." ;
                             ...
                             Pl3 => "..." }
    } ;
```
