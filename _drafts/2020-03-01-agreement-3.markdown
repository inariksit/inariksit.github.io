_This is the third post in the agreement series. Reading the previous posts ([part I](https://inariksit.github.io/gf/2020/05/14/agreement-1.html), [part II](https://inariksit.github.io/gf/2020/11/17/agreement-2.html)) is recommended for the general context, but as long as you know some basic linguistics and GF, the examples in this post are understandable._

In the first post, we learned that many languages mark the core argument(s) like subject, object and indirect object in the verb inflection.

In the second post, we learned that some languages mark also the addressee. Then I argued that [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)) can also be thought of as agreement: the argument that is marked is the situation itself.

In this post, I'm going to take it a bit more general still. If an orthographical word in any category depends on various elements in the tree, I'll call that agreement.
<!-- This calls for one of those [alignment chart memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/alignment-charts). -->


## Zulu predicative

Let's start with easy mode.
I'll quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Zulu_copulatives):

> While Zulu does have a copula verb -ba (“to be”), it is not used in the present indicative.
> Instead, various ways of expressing the copula exist in this case. [--] The copulative form [--] is formed by prefixing the __copulative particle__ to the full form of the noun.

Let's take an example.

| Zulu         | English                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| umngane      | 'a friend'                     |
| nginomngane  | 'I have a friend'              |
| anginamngane | 'I don't have a friend'        |
| unomngane    | 'he/she has a friend'          |
| awunamngane  | 'he/she doesn't have a friend' |


No verb involved, but a bunch of agreement. We can identify at least subject and polarity. Unclear from this sample what exactly the subject agrees with, we just see that it's different for P1 Sg and P3 Sg. Let's look at some more evidence.


| Zulu                 | English              |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| imilenze             | 'legs'               |
| inyoni inemilenze    | 'the bird has legs'  |
| isihlalo sinemilenze | 'the chair has legs' |
| izihlalo zinemilenze | 'chairs have legs'   |

So what is this an evidence of? _Bird_, _chair_ and _chairs_ all behave differently as possessors, and that difference is marked in the possessed noun.

If you want to play linguistic detective, stop reading here and try to form your own hypothesis. Once you're done, you can resume the post.

### GF implementation



https://github.com/LauretteM/gf-rgl-zul/blob/master/src/zulu/ResZul.gf#L31
VPType = CopIdent | CopAssoc | CopDescr | CopEq | … (non-copula VP types)

the associative copula can, if I understand correctly, be translated as "X has Y"
In ExtraZul, there are bunch of copula funs, of type NP -> VP, among them [AssocCop](https://github.com/LauretteM/gf-rgl-zul/blob/master/src/zulu/ExtraZulAbs.gf#L8)

In English, you'd say "I have a nose" with this tree

```haskell
PredVP
  (UsePron i_Pron)
  (ComplSlash
     (SlashV2a have_V2)
     (DetCN (DetQuant IndefArt NumSg) (UseN nose_N)))
```

And in Zulu, with this tree.

```haskell
PredVP
  (UsePron i_Pron)
  (AssocCop
     (DetCN (DetQuant IndefArt NumSg) (UseN nose_N)))
```

<!--
In the current (unfinished) Zulu grammar, `have_V2` isn't even implemented.
Of course, it's perfectly possible to implement `have_V2` in a way that `ComplSlash (SlashV2a have_V2) np` linearises the same as `AssocCop np`.
In such a grammar, `have_V2` wouldn't contribute with an independent verb form, instead, it would just carry the param `CopAssoc` over to the `VP`, and finally `PredVP` does all the magic.

(If GF still had a working `def` feature, it would be a natural choice to make a def rule between  `ComplSlash (SlashV2a have_V2) np` and `AssocCop np`. But that feature isn't supported by practically anything.)
-->

Again, there's technically no verb form there. Just bunch of noun class agreement attached to other nouns. Skip the verb altogether, nouns can do agreement perfectly fine without a verb!

But in the GF RGL, we see that the most practical place to put all of this in place is `PredVP`.

If you read the [latest agreement post on Basque](../../../2020/11/17/agreement-2.html#allocutive-agreement-in-basque), we also did lots of complicated decisions in `PredVP`. It's not a coincidence. That's just a very good place to make decisions! That's when you finally know the subject.

## Somali prepositions

First I need to make you appreciate how cool this is. Examples from [Saeed (1999)](https://benjamins.com/catalog/loall.10) pages 39 and 110.


### Imperative mood

Somali grammar books like to start with imperative sentences, because imperative is morphologically the simplest verb form, and syntactically the simplest construction.
As [Saeed (1982)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161528208.pdf) puts it, _"grammaticalisation of pragmatic functions is at the core of Somali syntax."_

### Prepositional phrase


![SomaliPrepContr0](/images/somali-preposition-contraction-0.png "A single Somali preposition: 'Cali shaah u samee', translation 'Make some tea for Ali'")

![SomaliPrepContr1](/images/somali-preposition-contraction-1.png "Somali preposition contraction: 'Faarax sidan ugu samee', gloss 'Faarax si-tan u+u samee', translation 'Do it in this way for Farah'")

![SomaliPrepContr2](/images/somali-preposition-contraction-2.png "Somali preposition contraction: 'Cali lacagta nooga soo qaad', gloss 'Cali lacag-ta na+u+ka soo qaad', translation 'Get the money for us from Ali'")

### Blah

The theme lately has been "postpone all decisions to Cl, only boring normies are done with verb inflection by VP".

I'm glad to tell you that in Somali, we choose the actual preposition combination in `UseCl : Temp -> Pol -> Cl  -> S`.

Why wait for so long? Don't we know all the arguments of the preposition combination already since VP?

Yes, but those aren't actually all the arguments. The phrase is open for polarity until `S`. Negation is, in fact, yet another possible component in the string. Here's an example from [Nilsson](http://morgannilsson.se/Kort%20somalisk%20grammatik.pdf).

| Somali                       | English                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Waan <span style="background-color: PaleGreen">ka dul</span> boodi karaa. | I can jump <span style="background-color: PaleGreen">over</span> it.     |
| <span style="background-color: Wheat">I</span><span style="background-color: PaleGreen">ga</span><strong><span style="background-color: Yellow"><font color="crimson">ma</font></span></strong> <span style="background-color: PaleGreen">dul</span> boodi kartid.  | You can<span style="background-color: Yellow"><font color="crimson">not</font></span> jump <span style="background-color: PaleGreen">over</span> <span style="background-color: Wheat">me</span>. |


The example is not so clear because it differs in more than negation, but that's what Nilsson gives us. (My guess for "you can jump over me" would be *waad iga dul boodi kartaa*, but I really need to check it with someone who knows Somali.)

The negation morpheme, _ma_, is the final thing that fuses together with the preposition(s), object pronoun and other stuff there might be. I don't know if passive also gets attached. None of the sources I've read are complete about all combinations. (When you write a generative grammar, you notice how incomplete paper grammars are. :-P)

Of course, I can construct the two forms

Technically, we could wait even longer, because it's still possible to add adverbs to a `S`, but … we just need to draw the line somewhere. If you need a different word order than `AdvVP` and `AdVVP`, make as many custom funs on the VP level. The current `Adv` has 4 fields, to cover for 4 different placements in the VP. Exactly for the reason that we can avoid the need to add adverbs after it's become a Cl. Want it before the subject? There's a field for that. When you add the Adv to the `VP`, it just goes into a field in VP that will be added in front of the future subject. Before the object? Sure, there's a field for that. As the last thing in the whole sentence? There's a field for that. If I've missed a critical use case, just add one more field. Fields are cheap.
