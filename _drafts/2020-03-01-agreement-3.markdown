_This is the third post in the agreement series. Reading the previous posts ([part I](https://inariksit.github.io/gf/2020/05/14/agreement-1.html), [part II](https://inariksit.github.io/gf/2020/11/17/agreement-2.html)) is recommended for the general context, but as long as you know some basic linguistics and GF, the examples in this post are understandable._

In the first post, we learned that many languages mark the core argument(s) like subject, object and indirect object in the verb inflection.

In the second post, we learned that some languages mark also the addressee. Then I argued that [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)) can also be thought of as agreement: the argument that is marked is the situation itself.

In this post, I'm going to take it a bit more general still. If an orthographical word in any category depends on various elements in the tree, I'll call that agreement.



## Somali prepositions

First I need to make you appreciate how cool this is. Examples from [Saeed (1999)](https://benjamins.com/catalog/loall.10) pages 39 and 110.


### Imperative mood

Somali grammar books like to start with imperative sentences, because imperative is morphologically the simplest verb form, and syntactically the simplest construction.
As [Saeed (1982)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161528208.pdf) puts it, _"grammaticalisation of pragmatic functions is at the core of Somali syntax."_

### Prepositional phrase
