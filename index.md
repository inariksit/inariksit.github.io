<!-- I create and maintain language resources at [Digital Grammars](https://www.digitalgrammars.com/), a company providing reliable multilingual language technology. -->
I am a lecturer in computer science at Chalmers University of Technology.
My [PhD](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/59037) is from the University of Gothenburg, where my research topic was applying software testing methods to computational grammars.
In addition, I contribute actively to the [Grammatical Framework](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/) Resource Grammar Library.
