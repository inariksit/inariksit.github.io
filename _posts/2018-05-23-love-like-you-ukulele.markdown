For my first blog post, here's how I play "Love like you" from Steven Universe on ukulele. I found bunch of ukulele tabs, but they are either too difficult (like [this](https://ukutabs.com/r/rebecca-sugar/love-like-you/)), so simple that they don't sound right, or require a capo (which I don't have). So this is a version that is feasible for a beginner but still sounds decent!

```
(A part)
F            Gm
If I could begin to be
Am               A7
Half of what you think of me 
        Dm          D
I could do about anything
             Gm           C
I could even learn how to love
F              Gm
When I see the way you act
Am                 A7
Wondering when Iâ€™m coming back
        Dm          D
I could do about anything 
             Gm           C
I could even learn how to love
     Am     Dm
Like you...
           Am       C
Love, like you...
 

(B part)
         Gm                  C
I always thought, I might be bad,
        Am             A7
Now I'm sure that it's true,
         Gm              C
'cause I think you're so good,
        Am           D
And I'm nothing like you.
            Gm
Look at you go
        C
I just adore you
  Am          D 
I wish that I knew
     Gm        Am           C
What makes you think I'm so special

```

Repeat part A otherwise identical (except for lyrics), end in F major in "Love me like you".

And here's me playing ukulele. ^_^
