[Part I](https://inariksit.github.io/research/2018/06/06/my-research-1.html)

In a parallel universe, there was another grammar formalism called
Constraint Grammar (CG). While I hardly wrote any such grammars, I was
dating someone who wrote them, and at the same time, I was supervised
by someone who had an obsession to SAT-solvers. So the two worlds met
through me, and thus was a new research question born.

## Writing CG

I once wrote 19 rules. I wanted to get to 20, but the 19 already
worked better (on a specific corpus) than 300 (probably hand-tailored
for another corpus) and I was bored so it became 19.

## Testing CG

Well I already wrote a [whole thesis](https://listenmaa.fi/lic.pdf) about that.

## Doing weird things with CG

The symbolic sentences we came up with in the previous section are
cool. I wonder if we could do something else with them.

You can read Wen's [blog post](https://wenkokke.github.io/2016/constraint-grammar-can-count/) while I write this bit.
